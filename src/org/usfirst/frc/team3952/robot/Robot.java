/**
 * 0 = back right
   2 = nothing
	3 = climber
		//4 = front right
		//5 = nothing
		//6 = nothing
		//7 = agitator
		//8 = launcher motor
		//9 = left front
* 
* Rules which will keep this code easy to read
* 
* 0. Put decision logic (when should we shoot, when should we agitate) in Controller, put motor and 
* camera actions in Systems (MechanumWheels class, Shooter class) and keep the Robot class 
* as slim as possible. The less code there is in Robot, the easier it is to read.
* 1. Try to not pass controller in as an argument in method calls. That way,
* all the controller decision making is inside Robot. Itll make it easier to
* find out why certain things do what they do. If you pass in controller, you will have to
* look into that method, find out what it does and repeat for all other method calls 
* which accept controller as an argument. Note, this is just a part of Rule 0.
* 2. Keep Joystick, XboxController and others inside Controller class. This makes it easy to switch
* the actual controller without having to dig through a lot of code. If you want to switch controllers
* all you gotta do is change Controller class.
* 3. Prefix Controller boolean methods with should. For example
* 	public boolean shouldShoot(){
* 		//figures out whether it should shoot based on joy stick or xbox or something.
*   }
*
